# Cisco Zero Touch Provisioning



This work all started from Jeremy Cohoe's excellent [repository](https://github.com/jeremycohoe/c9300-ztp) and [post](https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/device-provisioning-with-ios-xe-zero-touch-provisioning).



### Tips

ZTP is supported on both management ports and front-panel ports. When a new device is switched on, it retrieves the IP address information of the TFTP/HTTP server where the Python script resides, and the folder path of the Python script.
